# Architecture Decisions

Decisions about **why** we chose certain approaches and architectures.

## What This Section Is For

Record design decisions: why we chose this technology, this pattern, or this strategy over alternatives.

## When to Use This Section

- You want to understand **why** something was chosen
- You're considering changing a major decision
- You want to see what options were evaluated

## When to Use Other Sections Instead

- **Need explanation/background** → [30-Concepts/README.md](../30-Concepts/README.md)
- **How to implement it** → [20-Tasks/README.md](../20-Tasks/README.md)
- **Exact fields/specs** → [40-Reference/README.md](../40-Reference/README.md)

## How ADR Pages Are Structured

Each ADR (Architecture Decision Record) includes:
- **Decision** (brief statement of what was chosen)
- **Context** (what problem needed solving?)
- **Options considered** (alternatives evaluated with pros/cons)
- **Decision rationale** (why we chose this option)
- **Implementation** (timeline and steps)
- **Consequences** (positive and negative tradeoffs)
- **Mitigation** (how we address downsides)
- **Review schedule** (when to re-evaluate)

## Important Note

ADRs are **permanent records**. They're never deleted, only marked "superseded" if a new decision replaces them.

**Disagreeing with a decision?** Before changing it:
1. Read the ADR (understand the original reasoning)
2. Check if a newer ADR supersedes it
3. Consider proposing a new ADR if change is warranted
