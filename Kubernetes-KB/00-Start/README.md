## Key Principles

This KB follows **Diataxis** routing: content is organized by user **intent**, not topic.

- **Task:** How do I...? (step-by-step)
- **Concept:** What is...? (explanatory)
- **Reference:** Exact syntax/fields (lookup)
- **Troubleshooting:** How do I fix...? (diagnosis)
- **Runbook:** Operational procedures
- **Release Notes:** What changed?
- **ADR:** Why did we choose...?
- **Glossary:** Terminology

See [[DOCUMENTATION_DOCTRINE.md]] for all the rules.
