## Key Principles

This KB follows **Diataxis** routing: content is organized by user **intent**, not topic.

- **Task:** How do I...? (step-by-step)
- **Concept:** What is...? (explanatory)
- **Reference:** Exact syntax/fields (lookup)
- **Troubleshooting:** How do I fix...? (diagnosis)
- **Runbook:** Operational procedures
- **Release Notes:** What changed?
- **ADR:** Why did we choose...?
- **Glossary:** Terminology

See [DOCUMENTATION_DOCTRINE.md](../../UDA%20-%20Kubernetes/DOCUMENTATION_DOCTRINE.md) for all the rules.

## Examples

**I want to deploy an app** → [Task - Deploy Your First Application](../20-Tasks/Task%20-%20Deploy%20Your%20First%20Application.md)

**I don't understand Pods** → [Concept - Pods](../30-Concepts/Concept%20-%20Pods.md)

**I need Pod API fields** → [Reference - Pod API](../40-Reference/Reference%20-%20Pod%20API.md)

**My Pod won't start** → [Troubleshooting - Pod Won't Start](../50-Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting%20-%20Pod%20Won%27t%20Start.md)
