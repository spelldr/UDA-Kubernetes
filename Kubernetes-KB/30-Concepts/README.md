# Concepts

Explanatory material to understand **why** and **how** Kubernetes works.

## What This Section Is For

Answer the question: "What is...?" Concepts explain the theory, architecture, and reasoning behind Kubernetes features.

## When to Use This Section

- You want to understand a concept deeply
- You're confused about why something works a certain way
- You want architecture diagrams and explanations
- You're learning before you practice

## When to Use Other Sections Instead

- **Need step-by-step instructions** → [[20-Tasks]]
- **Need complete guided tutorial** → [[10-Tutorials]]
- **Need exact syntax** → [[40-Reference]]
- **Something broken?** → [[50-Troubleshooting]]

## How Concepts Are Structured

Each concept includes:
- **Clear definition** (jargon-free, one sentence)
- **Why it matters** (what problem does it solve?)
- **Core ideas** (key components explained)
- **How it works** (mechanism/flow)
- **Relationships** (how it connects to other concepts)
- **Common misconceptions** (myths debunked)

## Audience Levels

Concepts are labeled for your knowledge level:
- **Beginner:** Starting from zero knowledge
- **Intermediate:** Some Kubernetes experience
- **Advanced:** Deep architectural knowledge

## Example Topics

- [[Concept - What is Kubernetes]]
- [[Concept - Pods]]
- [[Concept - Deployments]]
- [[Concept - Services]]
- [[Concept - Architecture Overview]]

## Routing Rules

From a **Concept**, you can link to:
- [[30-Concepts]] (related concepts)
- [[40-Reference]] (for specs)

You should NOT link Concept → Task. Instead, link to Tasks FROM Tasks themselves.

**Ready to practice?** Once you understand the concept, try [[20-Tasks]] or [[10-Tutorials]].
