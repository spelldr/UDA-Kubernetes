# Reference

Complete API and command documentation—a lookup tool for exact syntax and fields.

## What This Section Is For

Answer the question: "What are the exact fields/flags/options?" You already know what you need; you just need correct syntax.

## When to Use This Section

- You need exact API field names
- You're looking up all available options for a resource
- You want to verify parameter types and defaults
- You need complete parameter documentation

## When to Use Other Sections Instead

- **Want to understand how it works** → [30-Concepts/README.md](../30-Concepts/README.md)
- **Need step-by-step how-to** → [20-Tasks/README.md](../20-Tasks/README.md)
- **Learning from scratch** → [10-Tutorials/README.md](../10-Tutorials/README.md)

## How Reference Pages Are Structured

Each reference page includes:
- **Syntax** (YAML or command format)
- **Required fields** (table with descriptions)
- **Optional fields** (with defaults)
- **Field details** (comprehensive explanation of each)
- **Complete examples** (real working code)
- **Common commands** (create, list, describe, delete)
- **Constraints** (limitations and rules)

## Example Topics

- [Reference - Pod API](Reference%20-%20Pod%20API.md)
- Reference - Deployment API (planned)
- Reference - Service API (planned)

## Using This Section

Look up a resource:
1. Find the reference page: `Reference - [Resource Name] API`
2. Check required fields (table at top)
3. Read field details for the ones you need
4. Copy a complete example
5. Customize for your use case

## Routing Rules

From **Reference**, you can link to:
- [30-Concepts/README.md](../30-Concepts/README.md) (for explanation of why fields exist)
- Never Task (use Task → Reference instead)
