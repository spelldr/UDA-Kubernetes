# Tasks

Quick step-by-step "how-to" guides for accomplishing specific things.

## What This Section Is For

Answer the question: "How do I...?"  Each task is focused, procedural, and gets you to success fast.

## When to Use This Section

- You know what you want to do but not how
- You need step-by-step instructions
- You want a quick reference (5-10 minute read)
- You want copy-paste examples

## When to Use Other Sections Instead

- **Want to understand why/theory** → [30-Concepts/README.md](../30-Concepts/README.md)
- **Need complete guided learning** → [10-Tutorials/README.md](../10-Tutorials/README.md)
- **Need exact API fields** → [40-Reference/README.md](../40-Reference/README.md)
- **Something isn't working** → [50-Troubleshooting/README.md](../50-Troubleshooting/README.md)
- **Need to run operations** → [60-PlatformOps/README.md](../60-PlatformOps/README.md)

## How Tasks Are Structured

Each task includes:
- **Quick summary** (one sentence: what and why)
- **Prerequisites** (what you need first)
- **Step-by-step instructions** (numbered, with commands)
- **Verification** (how to know it worked)
- **Common pitfalls** (mistakes to avoid)
- **Next steps** (related pages)

## Example Topics

- [Task - Deploy Your First Application](Task%20-%20Deploy%20Your%20First%20Application.md)
- [Task - Create a Deployment](Task%20-%20Create%20a%20Deployment.md)
- [Task - Expose an Application with Services](Task%20-%20Expose%20an%20Application%20with%20Services.md)
- [Task - Scale a Deployment](Task%20-%20Scale%20a%20Deployment.md)

## Routing Rules

From a **Task**, you can link to:
- [40-Reference/README.md](../40-Reference/README.md) (for exact syntax)
- [30-Concepts/README.md](../30-Concepts/README.md) (for understanding)
- [50-Troubleshooting/README.md](../50-Troubleshooting/README.md) (for common errors)

Never link Task → Task (each should stand alone).
