# Tasks

Quick step-by-step "how-to" guides for accomplishing specific things.

## What This Section Is For

Answer the question: "How do I...?"  Each task is focused, procedural, and gets you to success fast.

## When to Use This Section

- You know what you want to do but not how
- You need step-by-step instructions
- You want a quick reference (5-10 minute read)
- You want copy-paste examples

## When to Use Other Sections Instead

- **Want to understand why/theory** → [[30-Concepts]]
- **Need complete guided learning** → [[10-Tutorials]]
- **Need exact API fields** → [[40-Reference]]
- **Something isn't working** → [[50-Troubleshooting]]
- **Need to run operations** → [[60-PlatformOps]]

## How Tasks Are Structured

Each task includes:
- **Quick summary** (one sentence: what and why)
- **Prerequisites** (what you need first)
- **Step-by-step instructions** (numbered, with commands)
- **Verification** (how to know it worked)
- **Common pitfalls** (mistakes to avoid)
- **Next steps** (related pages)

## Example Topics

- [[Task - Deploy Your First Application]]
- [[Task - Create a Deployment]]
- [[Task - Expose an Application with Services]]
- [[Task - Scale a Deployment]]

## Routing Rules

From a **Task**, you can link to:
- [[40-Reference]] (for exact syntax)
- [[30-Concepts]] (for understanding)
- [[50-Troubleshooting]] (for common errors)

Never link Task → Task (each should stand alone).

**Struggling?** If something doesn't work, see [[50-Troubleshooting]].
